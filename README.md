## 🌟 Project Motivation & Goal
Stock prices are volatile and influenced by various factors such as market trends, company performance, and global events. This project aims to analyze **Tesla's stock price movements**, identify **patterns**, and build **forecasting models** to predict future stock prices. 

### **🎯 Objective**
- Understand Tesla's historical stock price trends.
- Determine whether the stock price is **stationary or non-stationary**.
- Decompose stock price data into **trend, seasonality, and noise**.
- Apply **multiple forecasting models** to predict future prices.
- Compare model performance and select the best one for stock price forecasting.

### **🔍 Key Solutions & Outcomes**
✅ Identified **long-term stock price trends and seasonality patterns**.  
✅ Used **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test** to check for stationarity.  
✅ Applied **SARIMA, LSTM, XGBoost, Prophet, and NeuralProphet** for forecasting.  
✅ Developed a **hybrid model (LSTM + XGBoost + Prophet)** that outperformed individual models.  
✅ Provided **next steps** for improving accuracy and deploying the model in a real-world scenario.

## 📌 Project Summary
### **Key Questions Addressed**
1. **How has Tesla’s stock price changed over time?**
   - Visualized historical stock prices.
   - Identified trends and patterns.
2. **Is the stock price data stationary?**
   - Applied **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test** to check for stationarity.
   - Used differencing to make the series stationary.
3. **What are the underlying components of Tesla's stock price?**
   - Used **Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL Decomposition)** to separate **trend, seasonality, and noise.**
4. **What forecasting model works best for Tesla's stock price?**
   - Implemented and compared **SARIMA, LSTM, XGBoost, Prophet, Bayesian Ridge, and NeuralProphet models.**

### 📊 **Step-by-Step Process Followed**
#### **1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing**
- **Dataset Source**: MacroTrends Tesla Stock Price Data.
- **Steps Taken:**
  - Loaded **CSV file**.
  - Checked for missing values.
  - Renamed and formatted columns.
  - Converted the `date` column to `datetime` format.
  - Set `date` as the index and sorted the dataset.

#### **2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Visualized Stock Prices Over Time:**
  - Plotted **Tesla’s closing price** over time.
  - Identified **upward trends and fluctuations.**
- **Checked for Stationarity:**
  - Performed **ADF Test**.
  - **Results:**
    - Initial test: ❌ **Stock price is NOT stationary**.
    - Applied **first-order differencing**.
    - Re-tested: ✅ **Stock price is now stationary**.

#### **3️⃣ Trend and Seasonality Analysis**
- **Used STL Decomposition:**
  - **Trend**: Showed an overall increase in stock price with fluctuations.
  - **Seasonality**: Identified **recurring patterns**, likely based on **market cycles or earnings reports**.
  - **Residuals (Noise)**: Captured random fluctuations.

#### **4️⃣ Forecasting Models Used**
- **📌 SARIMA Model**
  - Found optimal `(p, d, q)` parameters using **Auto-ARIMA**.
  - Trained a **SARIMA(2,1,2)x(1,1,1,12)** model.
  - **Output:** Successfully trained model with AIC/BIC evaluation.

- **📌 LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Model**
  - Created **time sequences (60-day window).**
  - Built and trained an **LSTM model** with:
    - **Two LSTM layers (128 and 64 neurons).**
    - **Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.**
  - **Output:** Trained over 50 epochs with low MSE loss.

- **📌 XGBoost Model**
  - Used **closing price and volume** as features.
  - Trained **XGBoost model** on historical data.
  - **Output:** Made **accurate predictions on test data**.

- **📌 Prophet Model (by Facebook)**
  - Converted dataset to `ds` (date) and `y` (close price).
  - Trained **Prophet model** with daily seasonality.
  - **Output:** Forecasted future stock prices with **confidence intervals**.

- **📌 Hybrid Stacked Model**
  - Stacked predictions from **LSTM, XGBoost, and Prophet**.
